<p>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.</p>

<p>IPv6 intended to replace IPv4, which is still used by the majority of traffic on the Internet until 2019. At the end of 2018, according to a Google survey,</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>More than 25% of networks connected to the Internet advertise IPv6 connections.</li>
    <li>Google reports 49 countries have more than 5% of IPv6 traffic, and more new countries are joining.</li>
    <li>Google reports 24 countries have more than 15% of IPv6 traffic.</li>
  </ul>
