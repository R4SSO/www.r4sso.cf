<h2 id="what-is-ipv6">What is IPv6?</h2>

<p>Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.</p>

<p>IPv6 intended to replace IPv4, which is still used by the majority of traffic on the Internet until 2019. At the end of 2018, according to a Google survey,</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>More than 25% of networks connected to the Internet advertise IPv6 connections.</li>
    <li>Google reports 49 countries have more than 5% of IPv6 traffic, and more new countries are joining.</li>
    <li>Google reports 24 countries have more than 15% of IPv6 traffic.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is far above the conditions in September 2013, where IPv6 traffic was only 2% of the worldâ€™s Internet.</p>

<p>All devices on the Internet must have an IP address allocated to communicate with other devices. With so many new devices connecting to the Internet, this need increases drastically compared to existing IPv4 addresses. IPv6 uses 128 bits, allowing 2^128, or 3.4 x 10^38 addresses, or more than 7.9 x 10^28 times IPv4, which uses only 32-bit addresses. IPv4 only allows 4.3 billion addresses. Since these two protocols are not designed to interoperate with each other, this makes the IPv6 transition process difficult.</p>
