[{"content":"So i have generic xbox controller (its also had switch mode for nintendo switch) its work perfectly and detected as xbox before. Since i updated the kernel it detected as Nintendo Switch Pro Controller\nIf you having same problem like me here the solution. Most solution i found on internet either bind to specific driver or install specific driver , neither of them work.\nSo why just not unload or delete the module? It will still use that module when you plug it in.\nSo lets just blacklist the module. The module we need to blacklist is hid_nintendo so it will not load and use xpad (xbox driver) instead.\nFirst we need to unload the module\n1  # modprobe -r hid_nintendo   then put it on blacklist\n1 2 3  /etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf blacklist hid_nintendo   arch wiki said if you want effectively blacklist that module we need to put this\n1 2 3  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf install hid_nintendo /bin/true   then replug the controller.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s work! It\u0026rsquo;s now detected as xbox controller\n","date":"2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/2425/3809/products/9110-3_540x.png","permalink":"https://r4sso.github.io/p/xbox-controller-detected-as-nintendo-linux/","title":"Xbox Controller Detected As Nintendo (Linux)"},{"content":"Room: tryhackme.com/room/ignite\nReconnaissance nmap scan show it has webserver running\nlets find exploit for fuel cms version 1.4\n Gain access Exploit: exploit-db.com/exploits/47138\nOrginally the exploit is written in python2 \u0026amp; using burpsuite proxy.
