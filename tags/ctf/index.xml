      <description>Enumeration Basic enumeration starts out with an nmap scan. Nmap is a relatively complex utility that has been refined over the years to detect what ports are open on a device, what services are running, and even detect what operating system is running. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that not all services may be deteted correctly and not enumerated to it&amp;rsquo;s fullest potential. Despite nmap being an overly complex utility, it cannot enumerate everything.</description>
